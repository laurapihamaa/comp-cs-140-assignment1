I used the help of LLM-tools in coding and creating the docker files.
The llm-tools used are chatGPT and Github Copilot.

The motivation to use LLM tools is to ease out the coding part and make it more efficient. Copilot was mainly used within the editor to suggest what code I might be wanting to write next and whenever that suited my needs I picked it up. ChatGPT was more used for asking clarifications for things that I didnt understand.
I asked for ChatGPT to create the docker files and in this part I got some minor errors like:
1. the docker file for dotnet did not include the build part
2. the dotnet and java versions was very old
3. the folders were incorrect
The methods for fecthing uptime and used disk space were also suggestions from copilot and as I did not have time to go through them they might not provide what is actually wanted.

The written report was not assisted by LLM.
